## Why

[Goal 3](https://buildforsdg.andela.com/goal3) aims to ensure health and well-being for all, at every stage of life. While there has been significant improvement in global health in the last two decades, further progress is needed. Over the last 15 years, the number of childhood deaths has been cut in half. This proves that it is possible to win the fight against almost every disease. Still, we are spending an astonishing amount of money and resources on treating illnesses that are surprisingly easy to prevent. The new goal for worldwide Good Health promotes healthy lifestyles, preventive measures and modern, efficient healthcare for everyone.

## Setup

You should have **Python 3.5+** and **git** installed.

1. Clone the repo you've created from the template herein and change into the directory

   `git clone https://github.com/BuildForSDG/team-271-backend.git`

2. Change into repo directory

   `cd team-271-backend`

3. Install a **pipenv** or **virtualenv**, a virtual enviroment library for python

4. With that installed, you should create and avtivate the virtual environment by running:
   `pipenv shell` for **pipenv**
   or
   `virtualenv -p python3 <my-env-name>` for **virtualenv** and add it in the **.gitignore** file and activate it with
   `. <my-env-name>/scripts/activate` on _Windows_ or
   `. <my-env-name>/bin/activate` on _Mac_ or _Ubuntu_

5. With that installed, you should install project dependecies by running:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   or
   `pipenv install -r requirements.txt` for _pipenv_

   This will install all requirements in the _requirements.txt_ file.
